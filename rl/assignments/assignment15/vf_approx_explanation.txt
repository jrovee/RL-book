The implied MRP value function is exactly identical to the LSTD
value function, the TD value function is really close to the results
of these two method, and Monte Carlo is really far away. The fact that
the LSTD value function agrees with the implied MRP value function 
agrees with what we learned in class, which is that LSTD solves for the 
value function of the implied MRP given by empirical probabilities.
TD is really close to this, but not quite equal bc of stochastic error. 
And MC is really far away, since MC is high-variance and we had a tiny 
number of traces, so the variance dominates the error.
